# Prompt-Engineering-4.1
# EXP 4 Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques- Lab Scenario: Smart Health Assistant System
# Description: 
You are part of a development team building MediGuide, an AI-powered Smart Health Assistant designed to support elderly patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and arthritis.
MediGuide aims to improve patient care through:

1. Personalized health advice

2. Timely medication reminders

3. Daily well-being tips

4. Friendly emotional support

The system should understand natural human language, adapt to user needs, and provide safe, compassionate, and context-aware responses.

## Objective:
To demonstrate how various AI prompting techniques can be used to train and optimize MediGuide’s conversational abilities across different health-related use cases.

We explore the following diverse prompting techniques:

1. Zero-Shot Prompting

2. Few-Shot Prompting

3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

4. Role-Based Prompting

5. Multi-Modal Prompting

## Algorithm / Prompting Techniques & Examples:
### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting
#### Objective:
Provide a task to the AI without giving any examples.
#### Use Case:
Giving general health tips to diabetic patients.

#### Prompt Example:

"Provide a health tip for an elderly diabetic patient."

#### Expected Output:

"Make sure to check your blood sugar levels regularly and avoid skipping meals. Include fiber-rich foods and stay hydrated."

#### Explanation:
Zero-shot prompting tests the AI's ability to generate relevant responses based only on task phrasing, useful for generalized use cases.

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting
#### Objective:
Teach the AI how to respond using a few examples, helping it generalize to similar requests.
#### Use Case: 
Answering symptom-related questions.

#### Prompt Example:

"Here are examples of responses to common symptoms:
'I have a headache.' → 'Make sure you're well-hydrated and rest in a quiet, dark room. If it persists, consult your doctor.'
'My knee hurts.' → 'Try applying a warm compress and avoid putting too much pressure on it today.'
Now respond to: 'I feel dizzy in the morning.'"

#### Expected Output:

"Dizziness in the morning can be due to low blood pressure or dehydration. Try getting up slowly and drinking water. If it continues, consult a healthcare professional."

#### Explanation:
Few-shot prompting helps fine-tune MediGuide’s ability to generalize safe advice across similar health queries.

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting
#### Objective:
Guide the AI through a step-by-step reasoning process.
#### Use Case:
Handling complex situations like missed medications.

#### Prompt Example:

"A patient forgot to take their blood pressure medication this morning. Think step-by-step to decide what advice to give."

#### Expected Output:

#### Step 1: Identify how late the dose is.
#### Step 2: If it's only a few hours, it may be safe to take it now.
#### Step 3: If it's close to the next dose, it may be better to skip and resume the regular schedule.
#### Step 4: Recommend contacting their healthcare provider for confirmation."

#### Explanation:
Chain-of-thought prompting is useful for multi-step decisions, encouraging logical reasoning and safety awareness.

### 4. Role-Based Prompting
#### Objective:
Assign a specific role or persona to shape tone and empathy.
#### Use Case:
Providing emotional support.

#### Prompt Example:

"You are a kind and empathetic health assistant for elderly users. Respond to this: 'I feel lonely and tired today.'"

#### Expected Output:

"I'm really sorry you're feeling this way. You’re not alone — I’m here to talk anytime. Maybe a short walk, some music, or calling a loved one could lift your mood a little. Would you like me to suggest a calming activity?"

#### Explanation:
Role-based prompts create compassionate and human-like conversations, important for patient comfort and engagement.

### 5. Multi-Modal Prompting
#### Objective:
Combine text with other input types, such as images, schedules, or audio.
#### Use Case:
Analyzing medication schedules or diet plans.

#### Prompt Example:

(Input: Image of a meal plate + Text: "Is this a good breakfast for a diabetic?")

#### Expected Output:

"This meal looks high in carbohydrates due to the white bread and fruit juice. For a diabetic-friendly breakfast, consider whole grain toast, a boiled egg, and unsweetened tea."

#### Explanation:
Multi-modal prompting enables the assistant to understand visual inputs alongside text, useful in health and nutrition contexts.

### Output:
Each prompting technique was successfully applied to specific health support scenarios within the MediGuide system. The responses generated were context-aware, empathetic, and medically aligned with common chronic disease management practices.

### Result:
The Smart Health Assistant MediGuide was effectively optimized using a variety of prompting strategies. This demonstrated how diverse prompt engineering techniques can significantly enhance the accuracy, clarity, and empathy of AI responses in sensitive healthcare environments.
